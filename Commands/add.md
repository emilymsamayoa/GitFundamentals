# Git Add
When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you will need to use the `git add` command. Items that have not ben "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changed will be marked as motified. Generally, you can ger away with `git add .` which will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed or deleted. You can track change to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will track specifically file1 and file2. You can specify adding directorys with `git add DirectoryName`.
