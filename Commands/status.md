# Git Status
The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on, you guessed, the status of your repository. Using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need pushed/pulled etc.
Status is a command that is safe to use any time. If you want to see whats going on it's good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know the flow better.
```
git add.
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push
git status
```
