# Git Clone
Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be  clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history. It will also be associated with the remote, meaning you can use the [git pull](../pull.md) to pull updates from the original.

It can be done with the `git clone` commmand as seen here:
```
git clone https:github.com/ElevenFiftyAcadamy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
